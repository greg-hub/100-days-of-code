# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2016 (Web scraper)
Built a basic web scraper in Node.js. The app scrapes the breaking SkyNews headline and description.

**Today's Progress**: Read an artical about building a Web scraper web scraping with inpisred me to build one.

**Thoughts:** : I had not looked at this before so it was very interesting to build with the npm packages.
